key features
Employee
An employee can login to see their own reimbursements, past and pending
An employee can submit a reimbursement with an amount and a reason
Bonus allow for file upload
Manager
A Manager can view all reimbursements past and pending
A Manager can appove or deny any reimbursement
Managers can view a 'statistics' page. That includes information like what employee spends the most money, mean expenditure cost etc...
Key Notes
you do not have to allow for the creation of employees or managers.
You can have these already in the database.
You do not need to have implement security for application. You can assume that a later security team is responsible for making the applicaiton secure.
API routes do not need to be protected
Passwords do not have to be encrpted
Technical and testing requirements
Backend developed in Javalin
Backend should be a RESTful web service
You may have to a make a non-REST compliant endpoint for login. This is normal.
AWS postgres RDS used to persist information
All DAO methods should have a test
All Service methods with logic should have a test
use mocking when applicable
There should be logging in the application
All user stories and acceptance criteria must be written out
completed E2E tests using gherkin and selnium for all user stories.
